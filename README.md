# Analyze_ab_test_results
This is a project work of Udacity Nanodegree Data Analyst, chapter Practical Statistics. 
In this project, I used data to understand te results of an A/B test run by an ecommerce website and help the company to understand if they should implement the new design. 

The statistical knowledge used are:
1. A/B test, hypothesis test;
2. Probebility;
3. Binominal distribution;
4. Sampling distributions;
5. confidence intervals;
6. Multilinear regression and logical regression.
